# CreditSea - Loan Management System

CreditSea is a premium, modern Loan Management System designed to make credit accessible, transparent, and simple for everyone. The application is built with a dual-portal design: a borrower experience for applying and tracking credit, and an executive experience for checking leads, approving sanctions, managing disbursements, and recording collections.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Vibrant Borrower Dashboard**: Track your past loan applications with dynamic color-coded status badges and interactive summaries.
* **Intelligent AI Doubt Solver**: A floating conversational chatbot helper on the landing page that automatically resolves queries about eligibility, document size, interest rates, and NBFC regulations in real time.
* **Circular EMI Loan Calculator**: Dynamic visual SVG Donut Chart rendering Principal vs. Interest allocations with beginner-friendly jargon definitions.
* **Multi-step Loan Application Flow**: Paperless multi-step profile builder guided by an automated Business Rule Engine (BRE).
* **Role-Based Executive Dashboards**: Custom portals built for:
  * **Sales (Leads)**: View registered borrowers.
  * **Sanction**: Audit salary slips and approve/reject applications with reason tracking.
  * **Disbursement**: Handle releasing of sanctioned credit lines.
